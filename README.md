# Travelers Toll
 
this is a small project that I am mainly using as a way to practice writing. Im doing this alongside neighborhood so the product is a bit lacluster, but It was fun to work on.

there isnt much you need to know in terms of controls:

wasd to move

mouse to look

f to interact

there are only a few interactions built in right now.

there are some spelling/grammar errors since there isnt any spellcheck, I will probably fix them at some point but not right now

if you want to see the game without having to go play it check out the video here:
